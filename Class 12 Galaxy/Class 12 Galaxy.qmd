## Section 4 Population analysis

>Q13: Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes.

Hint:
The read.table(), summary() and boxplot() functions will likely be useful here.
There is an example R script online to be used ONLY if you are struggling in vein. Note that you can find the medium value from saving the output of the boxplot() function to an R object and examining this object.
There is also the medium() and summary() function that you can use to check your
understanding.

```{r}
expr <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
head(expr)
```

```{r}
nrow(expr)
```

```{r}
table(expr$geno)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

>Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the expression of ORMDL3?

A/A shows higher expression than G/G. It seems that the SNP effect the expression of ORMDL3.

Hint: An example boxplot is provided overleaf â€“ yours does not need to be as polished as this one.

Let's make a boxplot.

```{r}
ggplot(expr) + aes(geno, exp, fill=geno) +
  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)
```
